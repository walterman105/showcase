# Showcase

Showcase turns a jailbroken cellular iPad into a software wireless CarPlay receiver. The iPhone pairs through Settings, joins the iPad hotspot, sends the encrypted CarPlay video stream, and receives touch input from the iPad.

The first public beta ships in two package architectures. Rootful users get the iOS 12-14 build. Rootless users get the iOS 15-17 build for Dopamine and palera1n rootless.

## Install

Add the package source in Sileo, Cydia, or Zebra.

```text

```

Then install `Showcase`.

## Requirements

| Item | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| iPad | Cellular iPad with Personal Hotspot |
| Tested rootful receiver | iPad Air 1 cellular, A1475, iPad4,2, iOS 12.5.8, checkra1n |
| Community rootless target | Cellular iPads on iOS 15-17, Dopamine or palera1n rootless |
| Runtime packages | `libssl3`, `uikittools` |

Sileo, Cydia, and Zebra install runtime packages through normal APT dependency resolution. Manual dependency installation is only needed when sideloading a `.deb` with `dpkg -i`.

The package bundles `BTdaemon`, `libBTstack.dylib`, and the BTstack launch daemon needed for `/tmp/BTstack`. It conflicts with the old `ch.ringwald.btstack` package to avoid file ownership collisions.

## What Works

- Wireless CarPlay discovery over Bluetooth and AirPlay/mDNS.
- BTstack takeover while the receiver runs.
- iAP2 link setup, identification, BAA authentication, Wi-Fi handoff, and EAP session setup.
- AirPlay pair-setup, pair-verify, auth-setup, RTSP control, timing, event channel, and screen stream setup.
- H.264 screen stream decryption with ChaCha20-Poly1305.
- Single-finger touch forwarding over the encrypted event channel.

## Build From Source

Showcase builds on the jailbroken iPad. The build script expects SSH access through a local forwarded port.

```sh
iproxy 2222 <ipad-sshd-port>
IPAD_PORT=2222 IPAD_PASS=alpine ./build_and_install.sh
```

For a jailbreak SSH daemon on port 22, run this command.

```sh
iproxy 2222 22
```

The script compiles the three binaries on-device, signs them with `ldid`, installs `/Applications/Showcase.app`, and refreshes SpringBoard.

## Build The Deb

Build and test the app on the iPad first.

```sh
cd packaging
./scripts/fetch-installed-app.sh
./scripts/build-rootful-deb.sh
./scripts/build-rootless-deb.sh
./scripts/generate-apt-repo.py repo
```

The `.deb` files land in `packaging/build/`. The APT repository lands in `packaging/repo/`.

For GitHub Releases, upload both `.deb` files from `packaging/build/` after you rebuild the packages. The rootful asset ends in `iphoneos-arm.deb`; the rootless asset ends in `iphoneos-arm64.deb`.

For Sileo, Cydia, and Zebra, publish the generated `packaging/repo/` contents to the web path that serves `https://aminerostane.com/repo`.
